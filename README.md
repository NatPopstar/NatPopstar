### Hello, my name is Natalia (www.linkedin.com/in/nataliapopovaqa). 
### Hi there. My name is Natalia, I am 30 y.o. All my life I am trying to find myself. I have a big layer of professions, in which I have theoretical and practical experience. Last year I got a profession - QA Engineer. For a long time I pursued the goal of becoming a developer. But... I lived in my own world - home, study, computer. I had very little contact with people and realized that I was fading. 
### I love communication and people. Without interlocutors, the world seems empty and nondescript. It was a pity to leave the profession of a programmer halfway, but in the process of reading the book "Forty-Five Tattoos of a Manager", I read a phrase that was imprinted in my heart. 
### “To abandon the wrong strategy means to show common sense, the ability to take control of the situation, slow down in time, turn the steering wheel in time. Let them laugh at you and say that you lost because you stopped. Let's see what happens. What will happen to these people who will be the last ones to have a good laugh.” Maxim Batyrev
### After this phrase, I decided that with love for people it is necessary to go into a profession that will allow me to communicate with people more and more often. I chose project management.
